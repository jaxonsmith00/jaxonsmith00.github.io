## The Origins and basics of the Passenger Pigeon

-Medium sized, and found in the large forested areas of the U.S., but there were many midwest U.S. sightings too

-It accounted for 40% of bird population when the settlers came to America, having a total of 5 billion in all

-They flocked together, were built for speed, and could fly for up to 8 hours at a time

-The average lifespan was 15 years and they often reached sexual maturity at month 2 and learned to fly once they fully had gained the strength, which was based on food intake. SO that factor varied depending on living conditions, etc.

-Their behavior was based on making sure predators knew that they werenÂ´t afraid of them, not consealing nests and traveling in flocks were some of the things that they did

### Drive to extinction

-There were many reasons for the Passenger Pigeon to go extinct, a major reason being the humans killing them for eating their corn, killing them for meat, just wanting to hunt an animal. And just reducing the population so much thats its own biology was able to make it not able to keep alive 

-As previously stated, there were originally 5 billion passenger pidgeons when the settlers arrived in america



-The animal that replaced the Passenger Pigeon was the **_Columbidae_** or just the regular pigeon.
