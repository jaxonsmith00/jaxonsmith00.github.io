## The Origins and basics of the Passenger Pigeon

-Medium sized, and found in the large forested areas of the U.S., but there were many Midwest U.S. sightings too

-It accounted for 40% of bird population when the settlers came to America, having a total of 5 billion in all

-They flocked together, were built for speed, and could fly for up to 8 hours at a time

-The average lifespan was 15 years and they often reached sexual maturity at month 2 and learned to fly once they fully had gained the strength, which was based on food intake. SO that factor varied depending on living conditions, etc.

-Their behavior was based on making sure predators knew that they weren´t afraid of them, not concealing nests and traveling in flocks were some of the things that they did

### Drive to extinction

-There were many reasons for the Passenger Pigeon to go extinct, a major reason being the humans killing them for eating their corn, killing them for meat, just wanting to hunt an animal. And just reducing the population so much that’s its own biology was able to make it not able to keep alive 

-As previously stated, there were originally 5 billion passenger pigeons when the settlers first noticed them in 1764 in America, but only a short 150 years later, the last passenger pigeon had died in a zoo in 1914.

#### Replacement organisms

-The organism that replaced the passenger pigeon was the _Columbidae_ or the regular pigeon, it didn’t fully replace the passenger pigeon. They breaded with each other, passing genes to and from each other.

-The pigeon replaced it because the passenger pigeons were hunted to extinction, and it needed to be replaced on the food chain as well as needed to be used in world war 1, to race, and to experiment on because of their high levels of intelligence.

-The other species that were affected by the passenger pigeon dying were the humans, the gran and fruit numbers, and finally insects such as spiders and grasshoppers. The eagles, hawks, and falcons were also all affected because they were the predatory birds that would eat the passenger pigeons

##### How extinction could have been stopped**

-To keep the passenger pigeons from dying, I would try to implicate a hunting law that only allotted a few passenger pigeons to be hunted each year, just so they had time to grow back and replenish the population that had been killed.
-I would’ve also made habitats for them so there could be certain places where they couldn’t be hunted and could be safe and make sure that more of them were put in zoos to preserve them. 

-The limitations on this would be that it would be hard to pass a law in old times because it was set, in some states, on what could and could not be done when the United States was just starting. 
- Zoos and habitats are hard to keep up to code and build and they cost lots of money which I don’t have.

And that is my presentation on the passenger pigeon, I hoped you enjoyed!
